                    <p class="card-text">This project aims to develop a web application designed to streamline the medical diagnostic process by integrating advanced AI capabilities. The application will allow doctors to input a patient's name and upload a medical image. Using a specialized model developed and trained at the Institut Mondor de Recherche Biom√©dicale (IMRB), the application will analyze the image and generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. This report, along with the patient's information, will be securely stored in a database, ensuring easy access and management of patient records. This innovative tool is intended to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnostics, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.</p>
